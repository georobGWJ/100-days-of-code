# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: January 11, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Diagrammed DB schema for CoCo app. Began debugging SAT choice menus.

**Thoughts:** Returned to working on DBC final project app, College Counselor (CoCo). Revisiting this code is bringing back to the DBC people and program which feels good. First goal, figure out why radio selection menus don't allow choosing the last date/location for SATs (it doesn't look like an indexing thing...)

I have some personal project ideas that will be started soon.
