# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 0: January 11, 2017
**Wednesday**

**Today's Progress**: Diagrammed DB schema for CoCo app. Began debugging SAT choice menus.

**Thoughts:** Returned to working on DBC final project app, College Counselor (CoCo). Revisiting this code is bringing back to the DBC people and program which feels good. First goal, figure out why radio selection menus don't allow choosing the last date/location for SATs (it doesn't look like an indexing thing...)

I have some personal project ideas that will be started soon.

### Day 1: January 12, 2017
**Thursday**

**Today's Progress**: Began building Electron based MP3-player app.

**Thoughts:** I want to learn [Electron](http://electron.atom.io/) to create client side apps. So I am. This MP3 app is fairly simple and should be a good base to extend using various techs. (Angular or Ember + Electron? Add a DB backend to track media? Other tech?)

Also, I reindexed my days. Yesterday I was really only doing maintenance, not building and I haven't committed that work yet, so today is the new Day 1.

### Day 2: January 13, 2017
**Friday**

**Today's Progress**: Added play functionality to electron-mp3.

**Thoughts:** HTML5 has built in functions to run audio and video files! I thought I would have to write that myself. I can focus on UX/UI and adding features going forward. :)

### Day 2: January 14, 2017
**Saturday**

**Today's Progress**: Add ability to choose among multiple songs and added volume control.

**Thoughts:** Sooo... Volume control is a lot more challenging than just playing an mp3. I'll do it.

### Day 3: January 15, 2017
**Sunday**

**Today's Progress**: Today I made the volume control actually work and abstracted the song selection menu. The menu is now dynamically created based on a local JSON file.

**Thoughts:** What I learned today. Managing local files using javascript can be tricky. I think that there's an easier way to do it than what I have implemented. Requiring 'fs' instead of writing XML to asynchronously access the file is probably cleaner and easier. I'm really close to MVP now though.
