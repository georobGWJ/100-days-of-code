# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 0: January 11, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Diagrammed DB schema for CoCo app. Began debugging SAT choice menus.

**Thoughts:** Returned to working on DBC final project app, College Counselor (CoCo). Revisiting this code is bringing back to the DBC people and program which feels good. First goal, figure out why radio selection menus don't allow choosing the last date/location for SATs (it doesn't look like an indexing thing...)

I have some personal project ideas that will be started soon.

### Day 1: January 12, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Began building Electron based MP3-player app.

**Thoughts:** I want to learn [Electron](http://electron.atom.io/) to create client side apps. So I am. This MP3 app is fairly simple and should be a good base to extend using various techs. (Angular or Ember + Electron? Add a DB backend to track media? Other tech?)

Also, I reindexed my days. Yesterday I was really only doing maintenance, not building and I haven't committed that work yet, so today is the new Day 1.

### Day 2: January 13, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Added play functionality to electron-mp3.

**Thoughts:** HTML5 has built in functions to run audio and video files! I thought I would have to write that myself. I can focus on UX/UI and adding features going forward. :)
